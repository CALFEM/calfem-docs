    =================

    CALFEM for Python contains several utility functions to make it easier to print out arrays and text in different ways and control verbosity of logging and error messages.

        To use these functions in Python the ``utils`` module needs to be imported, which can be done with the following statement:

        .. code:: python

            import calfem.utils as cfu

    .. include:: cfu_disp_hx.rst
    .. include:: cfu_disp_array.rst
