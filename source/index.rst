CALFEM is an interactive computer program for teaching the finite element method (FEM). The name CALFEM is an abbreviation of "Computer Aided Learning of the Finite Element Method". The program can be used for different types of structural mechanics problems and field problems.

CALFEM, the program and its built-in philosophy have been developed at the Division of Structural Mechanics, Lund University, starting in the late 70’s. Many coworkers, former and present, have been engaged in the development at different stages. 

.. only:: python

   This release represents the latest development of CALFEM for the Python language. The functions for finite element applications are all functions provided in several Python modules (.py-files) as described in the manual. We believe that this environment increases the versatility and handling of the program and, above all, the ease of teaching the finite element method. 

.. only:: matlab

   This release represents the latest development of CALFEM for MATLAB. The functions for finite element applications are all MATLAB functions (.m-files) as described in the MATLAB manual. We believe that this environment increases the versatility and handling of the program and, above all, the ease of teaching the finite element method.
